# Project Plan: Creative Fuel Website Clone

This document outlines the plan for creating a website clone of [creativefuel.io](https://creativefuel.io).

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to replicate the key features, design, and structure of the creativefuel.io website using a modern web development stack. This project will serve as a practical exercise in building a high-quality, statically generated website.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (with React)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (to be added)
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (or similar)

## 3. Key Features & Sections

The website will be a single-page application experience with the following sections on the homepage:

- **Header**: Logo and navigation.
- **Hero Section**: Full-screen with video background.
- **Services Section**: A grid or list of services offered.
- **Work/Portfolio Section**: A gallery of projects.
- **About Us Section**: Brief company information.
- **Testimonials Section**: Client quotes and logos.
- **Contact Form**: A form for user inquiries.
- **Footer**: Social media links, sitemap, etc.

## 4. Project Phases & Tasks

The project will be broken down into the following phases, with tasks managed in our TODO list:

1.  **Setup & Planning**: Initialize the project and define the structure.
2.  **Component Development**: Build reusable React components for each section.
3.  **Page Assembly**: Combine components to build the main pages.
4.  **Styling & Animations**: Apply styles and add motion effects.
5.  **Deployment**: Deploy the final application.

## 5. File Structure

A `src` directory will be used to house the application code:

```
