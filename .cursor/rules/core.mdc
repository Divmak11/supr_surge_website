# Core Rules

- Always reference the PRD (Product Requirements Document) for requirements, features, and acceptance criteria.
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices (e.g., TypeScript, React, functional components, named exports).
- Ask for clarification if any requirement or instruction is ambiguous.
- Do not modify existing code unless explicitly requested.
- Ensure all new code is well-documented and tested.
- Maintain clear commit messages and update documentation as needed.
- Only touch files where implementation is needed and nothing outside the scope.
